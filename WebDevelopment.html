            During my time at Bootcamp Henry, I embarked on an exciting journey
            of learning in the world of full-stack web development. Throughout
            the course, I acquired essential skills that complemented my prior
            knowledge of HTML, CSS, as well as programming and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I immersed myself in technologies such as JavaScript, React, Node,
            Next, Express, StyledComponents, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and LESS. I
            learned to create web applications with controlled forms and
            modularized components, giving a professional and stylized touch to
            my projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also mastered the creation of servers and the management of
            requests, enabling me to build dynamic routes for smoother
            navigation. Validating data received from forms became second
            nature, and I could respond to requests with appropriate status
            codes.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most exciting projects was Videogames Blackhole, an
            extensive video game library powered by the RAWG API, and The Sacred
            Fork, a cooking recipe website that leveraged the Spoonacular API to
            search, sort, and filter recipes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also took part in an exhilarating group project, ElectroShop,
            which focused on an online store for gamer items. We created a
            shopping cart and established a payment process using
            MercadoPagoSDK. Additionally, we allowed users to create accounts
            and utilized LocalStorage to maintain session data and the shopping
            cart. My time at Bootcamp Henry was an intense but incredibly
            rewarding experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            These skills complemented my existing knowledge and have prepared me
            for an exciting future in full-stack web development.
